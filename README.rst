IMPACT-Pipeline is a Perl/Python/R command-line software toolkit to process data, call variants (SNV,INDELS,SV,CNV) generated by NGS based MSK-IMPACT assay.
It is designed for use with hybrid capture, including both whole-exome and custom target panels, and short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina.
