IMPACT-Pipeline is a Perl/Python/R command-line software toolkit to process data, call somatic aberrations (SNV,INDELS,SV,CNV) generated by NGS based MSK-IMPACT assay.
It is designed for use with hybrid capture, including both whole-exome and custom target panels, and short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina.

Inside the config file
----------------------

There are three sections:

+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Section 1 | Section 2 | Section 3 |
+===========+===========+===========+
| Locations | Parameters| Versions  |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+

Inside Location Here are the things that need to be set:

:ZCAT: Location of the ``zcat`` program on linux 
:TMPDIR: Set the temporary directory for all tools please set somthing other then ``/tmp``
:JAVA_1_6: Set JAVA version 1.6
:JAVA_1_7: Set JAVA version 1.7
:GATK_SomaticIndel: Path to GATK somatic indel detector (GATK version 2.3-9)
:GATK: Path to GATK (GATK version 3.3.0)
:Reference: Path to fasta referece file to be used (GRCh37)
:Refseq: Path to refgene file to be used
:PICARD: Path to picard tools (Picard version 1.19)

Set the parameters to different file/folders/values required by the IMPACT pipeline

Inside the version there are version that are being used for each tool. This is just for consistency in reports.
